# VoiceApp311
VoiceApp311 connects voice assitants (currently only Alexa by Amazon) to Boston services and information. The goal is to return information about things like trash day, school cancelations, and community events, as well as allow reporting information to 311.

# Development

## Local environment
VoiceApp311 requires node to run. Go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install node. Once node is installed, VoiceApp311 dependencies can be insstalled by running `npm install` in the repository.

## Developing for Alexa
VoiceApp311 uses the [Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit) (ASK) to create a new Alexa skill. We suggest following along the [Alexa Skill Cookbook](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook) to get started running a skill quickly. Be sure to checkout the [tools](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/tools) section of the cookbook to make sure your environment is properly set up.
